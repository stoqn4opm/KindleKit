"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 1","","The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 2","","What makes each of these conversations crucial—and not simply challenging, frustrating, frightening, or annoying—is that the results could have a huge impact on the quality of your life."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 3","","Despite the importance of crucial conversations, we often back away from them because we fear we’ll make matters worse. We’ve become masters at avoiding tough conversations. Coworkers send e-mail to each other when they should walk down the hall and talk turkey."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 3","","Crucial Conversation kr shel kän´ vr sa´ shen) n A discussion between two or more people where (1) stakes are high, (2) opinions vary, and (3) emotions run strong. HOW DO WE TYPICALLY HANDLE CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS? Just because we’re in the middle of a crucial conversation (or maybe thinking about stepping up to one) doesn’t mean that we’re in trouble or that we won’t fare well. In truth, when we face crucial conversations, we can do one of three things:   • We can avoid them. • We can face them and handle them poorly. • We can face them and handle them well."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 4","","Walk away from crucial conversations and suffer the consequences. Handle them poorly and suffer the consequences. Or handle them well."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 6","","In our doped-up, dumbed-down state, the strategies we choose for dealing with our crucial conversations are perfectly designed to keep us from what we actually want."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 13","","Those who can’t handle their crucial conversations suffer in thirteen different ways (backstabbing, gossip, undermining, passive aggression, etc.) as much as three times more often in virtual teams than in colocated teams"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 13","","The key to real change lies not in implementing a new process, but in getting people to hold one another accountable to the process. And that requires Crucial Conversations skills."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 13","","In the worst companies, poor performers are first ignored and then transferred. In good companies, bosses eventually deal with problems. In the best companies, everyone holds everyone else accountable—regardless of level or position."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 14","","You know, people have different theories about how to manage their finances, spice up their love lives, or rear their children. In truth, everyone argues about important issues. But not everyone splits up. It’s how you argue that matters."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 16","","the negative feelings we hold in, the emotional pain we suffer, and the constant battering we endure as we stumble our way through unhealthy conversations slowly eat away at our health."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 19","","Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 22","","The mistake most of us make in our crucial conversations is we believe that we have to choose between telling the truth and keeping a friend."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 22","","For instance, we learned that when Grandma served an enormous wedge of her famous Brussel-Sprout Pie à la mode then asks, “Do you like it?”—she really meant: “Do you like me?” When we answered honestly and saw the look of hurt and horror on her face—we made a decision that affected the rest of our lives: “From this day forward, I will be alert for moments when I must choose between candor and kindness.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 22","","“How can I be 100 percent honest with Chris, and at the same time be 100 percent respectful?”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 23","","When it comes to risky, controversial, and emotional conversations, skilled people find a way to get all relevant information (from themselves and others) out into the open."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 23","","That’s it. At the core of every successful conversation lies the free flow of relevant information."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 23","","di·a·logue or di·a·log (dì´ ∂-lôg´´, -lòg) n The free flow of meaning between two or more people."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 24","","Filling the Pool of Shared Meaning Each of us enters conversations with our own opinions, feelings, theories, and experiences about the topic at hand. This unique combination of thoughts and feelings makes up our personal pool of meaning. This pool not only informs us, but also propels our every action. When two or more of us enter crucial conversations, by definition we don’t share the same pool. Our opinions differ. I believe one thing; you another. I have one history; you another. People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool—even ideas that at first glance appear controversial, wrong, or at odds with their own beliefs. Now, obviously, they don’t agree with every idea; they simply do their best to ensure that all ideas find their way into the open."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 24","","As the Pool of Shared Meaning grows, it helps people in two ways. First, as individuals are exposed to more accurate and relevant information, they make better choices."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 25","","Meaning didn’t flow freely because people were afraid to speak up."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 25","","people tend to hold back their opinions rather than risk angering someone in a position of power."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 25","","The Pool of Shared Meaning is the birthplace of synergy."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 26","","Conversely, when people aren’t involved, when they sit back quietly during touchy conversations, they’re rarely committed to the final decision. Since their ideas remain in their heads and their opinions never make it into the pool, they end up quietly criticizing and passively resisting. Worse still, when others force their ideas into the pool, people have a harder time accepting the information."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 27","","sometimes we move to silence. We play Salute and Stay Mute. That is, we don’t confront people in positions of authority. Or at home we may play Freeze Your Lover. With this tortured technique, we give loved ones the cold shoulder in order to get them to treat us better (what’s the logic in that?)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 27","","Sometimes we rely on hints, sarcasm, caustic humor, innuendo, and looks of disgust to make our points. We play the martyr and then pretend we’re actually trying to help. Afraid to confront an individual, we blame an entire team for a problem—hoping the message will hit the right target. Whatever the technique, the overall method is the same. We withhold meaning from the pool. We go to silence."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 33","","Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 35","","As much as others may need to change, or we may want them to change, the only person we can continually inspire, prod, and shape—with any degree of success—is the person in the mirror."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 36","","It’s the most talented, not the least talented, who are continually trying to improve their dialogue skills."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 36","","Skilled people Start with Heart. That is, they begin high-risk discussions with the right motives, and they stay focused no matter what happens."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 38","","When under attack, our heart can take a similarly sudden and unconscious turn. When faced with pressure and strong opinions, we often stop worrying about the goal of adding to the pool of meaning and start looking for ways to win, punish, or keep the peace."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 38","","Unfortunately, as we grow older, most of us don’t realize that this desire to win is continually driving us away from healthy dialogue. We start out with the goal of resolving a problem, but as soon as someone raises the red flag of inaccuracy or challenges our correctness, we switch purposes in a heartbeat."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 42","","Our motives usually change without any conscious thought on our part. When adrenaline does our thinking for us, our motives flow with the chemical tide."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 43","","Once you’ve asked yourself what you want, add one more equally telling question: How would I behave if I really wanted these results?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 44","","Asking questions about what we really want serves two important purposes. First, it reminds us of our goal. Second, it juices up our brain in a way that helps us keep focused."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 53","","the longer it takes to notice you’re not in dialogue, the harder it is to get back and the higher the costs.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 54","","So what do you look for when caught in the middle of a crucial conversation? What do you need to see in order to catch problems before they become too severe? Actually, it helps to watch for three different conditions: the moment a conversation turns crucial, signs that people don’t feel safe (silence or violence), and your own Style Under Stress."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 54","","To help catch problems early, reprogram your mind to pay attention to the signs that suggest you’re in a crucial conversation. Some people first notice physical signals—their stomach gets tight or their eyes get dry. Think about what happens to your body when conversations get tough."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 55","","Dialogue calls for the free flow of meaning"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 55","","nothing kills the flow of meaning like fear. When you fear that people aren’t buying into your ideas, you start pushing too hard."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 55","","people rarely become defensive simply because of what you’re saying. They only become defensive when they no longer feel safe."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 56","","if you don’t feel safe, you can’t take any feedback. It’s as if the pool of meaning has a lid on it. “What do you mean I look good? Is that some kind of joke? Are you insulting me?” When you don’t feel safe, even well-intended comments are suspect."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 57","","When others begin to feel unsafe, they start acting in annoying ways. Now, since they’re feeling unsafe, you should be thinking to yourself: “Hey, they’re feeling unsafe. I need to do something—maybe make it safer.” That’s what you should be thinking. Unfortunately, since others feel unsafe, they may be trying to make fun of you, insult you, or bowl you over with their arguments. This kind of aggressive behavior doesn’t exactly bring out the diplomat in you. So instead of taking their attack as a sign that safety is at risk, you take it at its face—as an attack. “I’m under attack!” you think. Then the dumb part of your brain kicks in and you respond in kind. Or maybe you try to escape."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 57","","recode silence and violence as signs that people are feeling unsafe."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 58","","Silence and Violence As people begin to feel unsafe, they start down one of two unhealthy paths. They move either to silence (withholding meaning from the pool) or to violence (trying to force meaning in the pool)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 58","","Silence consists of any act to purposefully withhold information from the pool of meaning."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 58","","The three most common forms of silence are masking, avoiding, and withdrawing. • Masking consists of understating or selectively showing our true opinions. Sarcasm, sugarcoating, and couching are some of the more popular forms. “I think your idea is, uh, brilliant. Yeah, that’s it. I just worry that others won’t catch the subtle nuances. Some ideas come before their time, so expect some, uh, minor resistance.” Meaning: Your idea is insane, and people will fight it with their last breath. “Oh yeah, that’ll work like a charm. Offer people a discount, and they’ll drive all the way across town just to save six cents on a box of soap. Where do you come up with this stuff?” Meaning: What a dumb idea. • Avoiding involves steering completely away from sensitive subjects. We talk, but without addressing the real issues. “How does your new suit look? Well, you know that blue’s my favorite color.” Meaning: What happened? Did you buy your clothes at the circus? Speaking of ideas for cost cutting—what if we diluted the coffee? Or used both sides of our copier paper? Meaning: If I offer trivial suggestions perhaps we can avoid discussing sensitive things like staff inefficiency. • Withdrawing means pulling out of a conversation altogether. We either exit the conversation or exit the room. “Excuse me. I’ve got to take this call.” Meaning: I’d rather gnaw off my own arm than spend one more minute in this useless meeting. “Sorry, I’m not going to talk about how to split up the phone bill again. I’m not sure our friendship can stand another battle.” (Exits.) Meaning: We can’t talk about even the simplest of topics without arguing."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 60","","Violence Violence consists of any verbal strategy that attempts to convince, control, or compel others to your point of view. It violates safety by trying to force meaning into the pool. Methods range from name-calling and monologuing to making threats. The three most common forms are controlling, labeling, and attacking. • Controlling consists of coercing others to your way of thinking. It’s done through either forcing your views on others or dominating the conversation. Methods include cutting others off, overstating your facts, speaking in absolutes, changing subjects, or using directive questions to control the conversation. “There’s not a person in the world who hasn’t bought one of these things. They’re the perfect gift.” Meaning: I can’t justify spending our hard-earned savings on this expensive toy, but I really want it. “We tried their product, but it was an absolute disaster. Everyone knows that they can’t deliver on time and that they offer the worst customer service on the planet.” Meaning: I’m not certain of the real facts, so I’ll use hyperbole to get your attention. • Labeling is putting a label on people or ideas so we can dismiss them under a general stereotype or category. “Your ideas are practically Neanderthal. Any thinking person would follow my plan.” Meaning: I can’t argue my case on its merits, so to get what I want I’ll attack you personally. “You’re not going to listen to them are you? For crying out loud! First, they’re from headquarters. Second, they’re engineers. Need I say more?” Meaning: If I pretend that all people from headquarters and all engineers are somehow bad and wrong, I won’t have to explain anything. • Attacking speaks for itself. You’ve moved from winning the argument to making the person suffer. Tactics include belittling and threatening. “Try that stupid little stunt and see what happens.” Meaning: I will get my way on this even if I have to bad-mouth you and threaten some vague punishment. “Don’t listen to a word Jim is saying. I’m sorry Jim, but I’m on to you. You’re just trying to make it better for your team while making the rest of us suffer. I’ve seen you do it before. You’re a real jerk, you know that? I’m sorry, but someone has to have the guts to tell it like it is.” Meaning: To get my way, I’ll say bad things about you and then pretend that I’m the only one with any integrity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 62","","the most difficult element to watch closely as you’re madly dual-processing is your own behavior."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 62","","when you fail to monitor your own behavior, you can look pretty silly."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 62","","famous words: “I’m not angry!”"
"Note","Page 62","","Sure sign of being abgry"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 72","","Look to see if others are moving toward silence or violence. • Look for outbreaks of your Style Under Stress."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 76","","Crucial conversations often go awry not because others dislike the content of the conversation, but because they believe the content (even if it’s delivered in a gentle way) suggests that you have a malicious intent. How can others feel safe when they believe you’re out to harm them? Soon, every word out of your mouth is suspect. You can’t utter a harmless “good morning” without others interpreting it in a negative way."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 77","","Mutual Purpose means that others perceive that you’re working toward a common outcome in the conversation, that you care about their goals, interests, and values. And vice versa. You believe they care about yours."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 77","","Mutual Purpose is the entry condition of dialogue. Find a shared goal, and you have both a good reason and a healthy climate for talking."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 77","","when Mutual Purpose is at risk, we end up in debate. When others start forcing their opinions into the pool of meaning, it’s often because they figure that we’re trying to win and they need to do the same."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 77","","Here are two crucial questions to help us determine when Mutual Purpose is at risk:   • Do others believe I care about their goals in this conversation? • Do they trust my motives?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 77","","To succeed in crucial conversations, we must really care about the interests of others—not just our own. The purpose has to be truly mutual. If our goal is to get our way or manipulate others, it will quickly become apparent, safety will be destroyed, and we’ll be back to silence and violence in no time."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 79","","The instant people perceive disrespect in a conversation, the interaction is no longer about the original purpose—it is now about defending dignity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 79","","To spot when respect is violated and safety takes a turn south, watch for signs that people are defending their dignity. Emotions are the key. When people feel disrespected, they become highly charged. Their emotions turn from fear to anger. Then they resort to pouting, name-calling, yelling, and making threats. Ask the following question to determine when Mutual Respect is at risk:   • Do others believe I respect them?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 82","","• Apologize • Contrast • Create a Mutual Purpose Each skill helps rebuild either Mutual Respect or Mutual Purpose."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 85","","When others misinterpret either your purpose or your intent, step out of the argument and rebuild safety by using a skill called Contrasting. Contrasting is a don’t/do statement that:   • Addresses others’ concerns that you don’t respect them or that you have a malicious purpose (the don’t part). • Confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose (the do part)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 86","","Of the two parts of Contrasting, the don’t is the more important because it deals with the misunderstanding that has put safety at risk."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 87","","Contrasting is not apologizing. It’s important to understand that Contrasting is not apologizing. It is not a way of taking back something we’ve said that hurt others’ feelings. Rather, it is a way of ensuring that what we said didn’t hurt more than it should have."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 87","","Contrasting provides context and proportion. When you’re in the middle of a touchy conversation, sometimes others experience your words as bigger or worse than you intend. For example, you talk with your assistant about his lack of punctuality. When you share your concern, he appears crushed. At this point, you could be tempted to water down your content—“You know it’s really not that big a deal.” Don’t give into the temptation. Don’t take back what you’ve said. Instead, put your remarks in context. For instance, at this point your assistant may believe you are completely dissatisfied with his performance. He believes that your view of the issue at hand represents the totality of your respect for him. If this belief is incorrect, use Contrasting to clarify what you don’t and do believe. Start with what you don’t believe."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 88","","Use Contrasting for prevention or first aid. Contrasting can be useful both as prevention and as first aid for safety problems. So far our examples have helped us apply first aid to a wounded conversation. Someone has taken something wrong, and we’ve intervened to clarify our true purpose or meaning."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 88","","When we’re aware that something we’re about to drop into the pool of meaning could create a splash of defensiveness, we use Contrasting to bolster safety—before we see others going to either silence or violence. “I don’t want you to think that I don’t appreciate the time you’ve taken to keep our checkbook balanced and up to date. I do appreciate it, and I know I certainly couldn’t have done nearly as well. I do, however, have some concerns with how we’re using the new electronic banking system.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 90","","Create a Mutual Purpose Let’s add one more skill. Sometimes we find ourselves in the middle of a debate because we clearly have different purposes. There is no misunderstanding here. Contrasting won’t do the trick."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 91","","Commit to Seek Mutual Purpose As is true with most dialogue skills, if you want to get back to dialogue, you have to Start with Heart. In this case, you have to agree to agree. To be successful, we have to stop using silence or violence to compel others to our view. We must even surrender false dialogue, where we pretend to have Mutual Purpose (calmly arguing our side until the other person gives in). We Start with Heart by committing to stay in the conversation until we invent a solution that serves a purpose we both share."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 93","","Before you can agree on a Mutual Purpose, you must first know what people’s real purposes are."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 93","","Invent a Mutual Purpose Sometimes when you recognize the purposes behind another person’s strategies, you discover that you actually have compatible goals. From there you simply come up with common strategies. But you’re not always so lucky. For example, you find out that your genuine wants and goals cannot be served except at the expense of the other person’s. In this case you cannot discover a Mutual Purpose. That means you’ll have to actively invent one. To invent a Mutual Purpose, move to more encompassing goals. Find an objective that is more meaningful or more rewarding than the ones that divide the various sides."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 94","","In summary, when you sense that you and others are working at cross-purposes, here’s what you can do. First, step out of the content of the conflict. Stop focusing on who thinks what. Then create a Mutual Purpose."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 101","","SUMMARY—MAKE IT SAFE Step Out When others move to silence or violence, step out of the conversation and Make It Safe. When safety is restored, go back to the issue at hand and continue the dialogue."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 101","","Decide Which Condition of Safety Is at Risk • Mutual Purpose. Do others believe you care about their goals in this conversation? Do they trust your motives? • Mutual Respect. Do others believe you respect them?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 101","","Apologize When Appropriate • When you’ve clearly violated respect, apologize."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 102","","Contrast to Fix Misunderstanding • When others misunderstand either your purpose or your intent, use Contrasting. Start with what you don’t intend or mean. Then explain what you do intend or mean."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 102","","Create a Mutual Purpose • When you are at cross-purposes, use four skills to get back to Mutual Purpose:   • Commit to seek Mutual Purpose. • Recognize the purpose behind the strategy. • Invent a Mutual Purpose. • Brainstorm new strategies."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 104","","Claim one. Emotions don’t settle upon you like a fog. They are not foisted upon you by others. No matter how comfortable it might make you feel saying it—others don’t make you mad. You make you mad. You make you scared, annoyed, or insulted. You and only you create your emotions."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 104","","Claim two. Once you’ve created your upset emotions, you have only two options: You can act on them or be acted on by them. That is, when it comes to strong emotions, you either find a way to master them or fall hostage to them. Here’s how this all unfolds."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 106","","The worst at dialogue fall hostage to their emotions, and they don’t even know it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 106","","The best at dialogue do something completely different. They aren’t held hostage by their emotions, nor do they try to hide or suppress them. Instead, they act on their emotions. That is, when they have strong feelings, they influence (and often change) their emotions by thinking them out. As a result, they choose their emotions, and by so doing, make it possible to choose behaviors that create better results."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 108","","Just after we observe what others do and just before we feel some emotion about it, we tell ourselves a story. We add meaning to the action we observed. We make a guess at the motive driving the behavior. Why were they doing that? We also add judgment—is that good or bad? And then, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds with an emotion."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 108","","We observe, we tell a story, and then we feel."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 109","","If we can find a way to control the stories we tell, by rethinking or retelling them, we can master our emotions and, therefore, master our crucial conversations."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 109","","Nothing in this world is good or bad, but thinking makes it so."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 110","","Storytelling typically happens blindingly fast. When we believe we’re at risk, we tell ourselves a story so quickly that we don’t even know we’re doing it. If you don’t believe this is true, ask yourself whether you always become angry when someone laughs at you. If sometimes you do and sometimes you don’t, then your response isn’t hard-wired. That means something goes on between others laughing and you feeling. In truth, you tell a story. You may not remember it, but you tell a story. Any set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of stories."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 111","","If we take control of our stories, they won’t control us. People who excel at dialogue are able to influence their emotions during crucial conversations."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 111","","once they’re told, the stories control us. They first control how we feel and then how we act. And as a result, they control the results we get from our crucial conversations."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 112","","Retrace Your Path To slow down the lightning-quick storytelling process and the subsequent flow of adrenaline, retrace your Path to Action—one element at a time."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 113","","When an unhelpful story is driving you to silence or violence, stop and consider how others would see your actions."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 113","","Not only do those who are best at crucial conversations notice when they’re slipping into silence or violence, but they’re also able to admit it. They don’t wallow in self-doubt, of course, but they do recognize the problem and begin to take corrective action. The moment they realize that they’re killing dialogue, they review their own Path to Action."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 114","","feelings come from stories, and stories are our own invention."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 114","","The first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge the illusion that what you’re feeling is the only right emotion under the circumstances."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 115","","Don’t confuse stories with facts. Sometimes you fail to question your stories because you see them as immutable facts. When you generate stories in the blink of an eye, you can get so caught up in the moment that you begin to believe your stories are facts. They feel like facts. You confuse subjective conclusions with steel-hard data points."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 116","","When we feel a need to justify our ineffective behavior or disconnect ourselves from our bad results, we tend to tell our stories in three very predictable ways."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 117","","Victim Stories—“It’s Not My Fault” The first of the clever stories is a Victim Story. Victim Stories, as you might imagine, make us out to be innocent sufferers. The theme is always the same. The other person is bad, wrong, or dumb, and we are good, right, or brilliant. Other people do bad or stupid things, and we suffer as a result."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 118","","Villain Stories—“It’s All Your Fault” We create these nasty little tales by turning normal, decent human beings into villains. We impute bad motive, and then we tell everyone about the evils of the other party as if somehow we’re doing the world a huge favor."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 118","","Not only do Villain Stories help us blame others for bad results, but they also set us up to then do whatever we want to the “villains.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 119","","Helpless Stories—“There’s Nothing Else I Can Do” Finally come Helpless Stories. In these fabrications we make ourselves out to be powerless to do anything healthy or helpful. We convince ourselves that there are no healthy alternatives for dealing with our predicament, which justifies the action we’re about to take."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 119","","While Villain and Victim Stories look back to explain why we’re in the situation we’re in, Helpless Stories look forward to explain why we can’t do anything to change our situation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 120","","Our need to tell clever stories often starts with our own sellouts. Like it or not, we usually don’t begin telling stories that justify our actions until we have done something that we feel a need to justify.1"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 121","","You had no reason to think he was selfish until you needed an excuse for your own selfish behavior. You didn’t start telling clever stories until after you failed to do something you knew you should have done."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 121","","the clever story helped you feel good about being rude."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 122","","A useful story, by definition, creates emotions that lead to healthy action—such as dialogue."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 123","","Turn victims into actors. If you notice that you’re talking about yourself as an innocent victim (and you weren’t held up at gunpoint), ask:   • Am I pretending not to notice my role in the problem?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 124","","Turn villains into humans. When you find yourself labeling or otherwise vilifying others, stop and ask:   • Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what this person is doing?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 129","","If strong emotions are keeping you stuck in silence or violence, try this. Retrace Your Path Notice your behavior. If you find yourself moving away from dialogue, ask yourself what you’re really doing. • Am I in some form of silence or violence? Get in touch with your feelings. Learn to accurately identify the emotions behind your story. • What emotions are encouraging me to act this way? Analyze your stories. Question your conclusions and look for other possible explanations behind your story. • What story is creating these emotions? Get back to the facts. Abandon your absolute certainty by distinguishing between hard facts and your invented story. • What evidence do I have to support this story? Watch for clever stories. Victim, Villain, and Helpless Stories sit at the top of the list."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 132","","When it comes to sharing touchy information, the worst alternate between bluntly dumping their ideas into the pool of meaning and saying nothing at all."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 136","","Once you’ve worked on yourself to create the right conditions for dialogue, you can then draw upon five distinct skills that can help you talk about even the most sensitive topics. These five tools can be easily remembered with the acronym STATE. It stands for:   • Share your facts • Tell your story • Ask for others’ paths • Talk tentatively • Encourage testing The first three skills describe"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 137","","starting with our ugly stories is the most controversial, least influential, and most insulting way we could begin."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 138","","Facts are the least controversial. Facts provide a safe beginning. By their very nature, facts aren’t controversial. That’s why we call them facts."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 138","","Facts form the foundation of belief. So if you want to persuade others, don’t start with your stories. Start with your observations."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 139","","While we’re speaking here about being persuasive, let’s add that our goal is not to persuade others that we are right. We aren’t trying to “win” the dialogue.

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 144","","Tentative, not wimpy. Some people are so worried about being too forceful or pushy that they err in the other direction. They wimp out by making still another Fool’s Choice. They figure that the only safe way to share touchy data is to act as if it’s not important."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 145","","It’s one thing to be humble and open. It’s quite another to be clinically uncertain. Use language that says you’re sharing an opinion, not language that says you’re a nervous wreck."

You’ve sincerely invited them, even encouraged differing views, but nobody says anything. To help grease the skids, play devil’s advocate. Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your own view. “Maybe I’m wrong here. What if the opposite is true? What if the reason sales have dropped is because . . .”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 150","","When we feel the need to push our ideas on others, it’s generally because we believe we’re right and everyone else is wrong.

It’s what people of character do."

When people begin to share their volatile stories and feelings, we now face the risk of pulling out our own Victim, Villain, and Helpless Stories to help us explain why they’re saying what they’re saying. Unfortunately, since it’s rarely fun to hear other people’s unflattering stories, we begin to assign negative motives to them for telling the stories."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 159","","To avoid overreacting to others’ stories, stay curious. Give your brain a problem to stay focused on. Ask: “Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person say this?” This question keeps you retracing the other person’s Path to Action until you see how it all fits together. And in most cases, you end up seeing that under the circumstances, the individual in question drew a fairly reasonable conclusion."

In mirroring, we take the portion of the other person’s Path to Action we have access to and make it safe for him or her to discuss it. All we have so far are actions and some hints about the other person’s emotions, so we start there."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 174","","SUMMARY—EXPLORE OTHERS’ PATHS To encourage the free flow of meaning and help others leave silence or violence behind, explore their Paths to Action. Start with an attitude of curiosity and patience. This helps restore safety. Then, use four powerful listening skills to retrace the other person’s Path to Action to its origins. • Ask. Start by simply expressing interest in the other person’s views. • Mirror. Increase safety by respectfully acknowledging the emotions people appear to be feeling. • Paraphrase. As others begin to share part of their story, restate what you’ve heard to show not just that you understand, but also that it’s safe for them to share what they’re thinking. • Prime. If others continue to hold back, prime. Take your best guess at what they may be thinking and feeling. As you begin to share your views, remember:   • Agree. Agree when you share views. • Build. If others leave something out, agree where you share views, then build. • Compare. When you do differ significantly, don’t suggest others are wrong. Compare your two views."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 179","","DECIDE HOW TO DECIDE Both of these problems are solved if, before making a decision, the people involved decide how to decide. Don’t allow people to assume that dialogue is decision making. Dialogue is a process for getting all relevant meaning into a shared pool. That process, of course, involves everyone. However, simply because everyone is allowed to share their meaning—actually encouraged to share their meaning—doesn’t mean they are then guaranteed to take part in making all the decisions. To avoid violated expectations, separate dialogue from decision making."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 182","","Consensus This method can be both a great blessing and a frustrating curse. Consensus means you talk until everyone honestly agrees to one decision. This method can produce tremendous unity and high-quality decisions. If misapplied, it can also be a horrible waste of time.

When it’s time to pass out assignments, remember, there is no “we.” “We,” when it comes to assignments, actually means, “not me.” It’s code. Even when individuals are not trying to duck an assignment, the term “we” can lead them to believe that others are taking on the responsibility."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 185","","To help clarify deliverables, use Contrasting. If you’ve seen people misunderstand an assignment in the past, explain the common mistake as an example of what you don’t want. If possible, point to physical examples. Rather than talk in the abstract, bring a prototype or sample. We learned this particular trick when hiring a set designer. The renowned designer talked about what he would deliver, and it sounded great to us. Twenty-five thousand dollars later he delivered something that would never work."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 186","","By When? It’s shocking how often people leave this element out of an assignment. Instead of giving a deadline, people simply point to the setting sun of “someday.” With vague or unspoken deadlines, other urgencies come up, and the assignment finds its way to the bottom of the pile, where it is soon forgotten. Assignments without deadlines are far better at producing guilt than stimulating action. Goals without deadlines aren’t goals; they’re merely directions."

If you’ve gone to the effort to complete a crucial conversation, don’t fritter away all the meaning you created by trusting your memories. Write down the details of conclusions, decisions, and assignments. Remember to record who does what by when. Revisit your notes at key times (usually the next meeting) and review assignments."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 192","","The Danger Point Often couples come to an unspoken agreement during the first year or so of their marriage that affects how they communicate for the rest of their marriage. Say one person is touchy and can’t take feedback, or the other doesn’t give it very well. In any case, they in effect agree to say nothing to each other. They live in silence. Problems have to be huge before they’re discussed. The Solution This is generally a problem of not knowing how to STATE Your Path. When something bothers you, catch it early. Contrasting can also help. “I’m not trying to blow this out of proportion. I just want to deal with it before it gets out of hand.” Describe the specific behaviors you’ve observed. “When Jimmy leaves his room a mess, you use sarcasm to get his attention. You call him a ‘pig’ and then laugh as if you didn’t mean it.” Tentatively explain the consequences. “I don’t think it’s having the effect you want. He doesn’t pick up on the hint, and I’m afraid that he’s starting to resent you” (Your story). Encourage testing: “Do you see it differently?”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 194","","When teams try to rally around aggressive change or bold new initiatives, they need to be prepared to address the problem when a team member doesn’t live up to the agreement.
